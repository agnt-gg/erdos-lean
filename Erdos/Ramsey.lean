The two-color Ramsey number `graphRamsey G H` is the minimum number of vertices `n`
such that every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on `n` vertices contains
a copy of `G` in the first color or a copy of `H` in the second color.

A 2-coloring of the complete graph on `Fin n` is represented by a graph `C` (the edges of the
first color) and its complement `Cᶜ` (the edges of the second color).
